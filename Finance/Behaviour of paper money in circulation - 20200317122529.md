# The behaviour of paper money in circulation

Relates to [[20200315170318]] money as medium of circulation. That note deals with general characteristics of circulation up to demonetisation, this note then discusses the circulation of fiat currency, which is itself a form/output of demonetisation.

**Distinction between paper money and credit, which represent two different things. Paper money is a demonetisation of gold. Credit money is a claim to future surplus value.**

>"[when paper money is adopted] ...the distinction between the functions of money would end up in a complete separation, depriving money of its initial significance and leaving it only a value dependent on its quantity. Instead of having a given value and a variable quantity as an instrument of circulation, paper money has a quantity determined by the amount printed, irrespective of the requirements of circulation, and a value inversely proportional to that quantity. What Marx called the "inherent laws of circulation," based on the role of the money commodity, appear to be abolished when th emedium of circulation, with no intrinsic value, depends on governmental decisions which fix the amount issued."

- de Brunhoff, Marx on Money, p. 33

**Paper money ultimately must signify a relationship of value, otherwise it can only exist in any meaningful way in circulation**
>"Marx rects [Ricardo's QTM] completely, not because he himself adheres to an exclusively "metallicist" concept of money, but because the idea of identifying fiat money and credit money with metallic money rests on a confusion of the different functions of money, reducing it to the single form of medium of circulation. Ricardo's mistake is that he "regards currency, the fluid form of money, in isolation.""

- de Brunhoff p. 35

**Changes in the supply of paper money will affect the value of paper money relative to gold, but not the underlying relationship between gold and other commodities - although this is unlikely to matter to people who only have paper money.**

"[Marx]...subsequently shows that in the end [the laws of circulation] nonetheless impose themselves, since paper money is only a symbol of gold and its circulation is in the last analysis regulated by the need for metallic money. If the state issues too much paper money in relation to the amount of gold it reprsents, the paper money devalues itself and the rise of prices absorbs the excess bills. "The effect would be the same as if an alteration had taken place in the function of gold as a standard of prices. Equilibrium restablishes itself in terms of a given value for monetary gold, which remains distinct from paper money. The nominal increase in prices thus has no economic importance, in the sense that it does not affect the primary determination of prices."

- de Brunhoff pp 35-6

"According to Marx paper money is true money, related to gold as its symbol...fiat money nevertheless has some of the character of "false money," inso far as it is condemned to remain in circulation. The state can issue paper money at its discretion, but it cannot subsequently withdraw it from circulation. And all the paper issued has to circulate...gold cannot be replaced by things without value [as a measure of value], by mere symbols...Paper money, true money insofar as it is a symbol of gold, also partakes of the character of "false money" preciscely because it can never be anything but a symbol, condemned to circulate without rest."

**Paper money only receives its significance through circulation, because for it to have meaning it has to be exchanged readily and continuously for commodities. It has no function as a store of value, so therefore when circulation breaks/pauses it loses its value.**

"The measure of value does not imply the actual circulation of money, once there has been the initial exchange which makes it possible to set up the *equation of price*, x commodity C = y money commodity. It is only money as an instrument of circulation that makes it possible to establish the formula for cash transactions, C - M - C (commodity - money - commodity). But th emoney which circulates in causing commodities to circulate and is hence found to be present "side by side with them" is not necessarily present as the money commodity. As currency, it can be represented by the symbol of gold, and "its functional existence absorbs, so to say, its material existence." The differences of nature and quantity between the measure of value and the currency both have the effect of separating the general equivalent from its money form, the specific commodity which functions as such in practice. From this arises..." *the discussion in de Brunhoff now moves onto [[20200317153833]] hoarding*.
