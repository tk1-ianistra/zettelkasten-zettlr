Then this commodity gets divided up into aliquot parts which are stamped with an essentially arbitrary designation initially based on their weight to make commerce more convenient (we can see here how the disconnect begins to occur - *this is fetishisation and alienation! the fetishisation of the money-form as a bearer of social power actually alienates us from value! from the social relationships of production and exchange that are embodied in the commodities the money-form comes to represent!!!)

		In simple circulation the standard of price has a "monetary price" fixed by convention:'A given weight of one of the precious metals, an ounce of gold, for instance, becomes officially divided into aliquot parts, with legally bestowed names, such as pound, dollar, etc. These aiquot parts, which henceforth serve as units of money, are then subdivided into other aliquot parts with legal names, such as shilling, penny, etc. But, both before and after these divisions are made, a definite weight of metal is the standard of metallic money....These prices, or quantities of gold, into which the values of commodities are ideally changed, are therefore now expressed in the names of coins, or in the legally valid names of the subdivisions of the gold standard.'... The name given a certain amount of gold, or "monetary price," serves as a unit of account. The specific form which the exchange-value of commodities assumes is converted into denominations of money, by which their value is expressed...only the "monetary price" belongs to gold as a standard unit of account, and that it has nothing to do with gold as a measure of value, which cannot have a price..."
- de brunhoff pp. 29-30 
 
 **"Every confusion between the different aspects of money, every exposition which disturbs the order indicated by Marx, has the effect of destroying the specific character of the money form..."** - de brunhoff (Marx on Money) p. 30
 
 - this is what is absolutely critical - the standard of price begins as simply a convenient standardisation to make it quicker, easier and more convenient to actually do business *in gold*, but it opens the door to fetishisation by disconnecting the standard of price from the measure of value!

>"In this light [of the logic of Marx's overall monetary theory], the fundamental problem posed by the circulation of fiat money with no intrinsic value is that of *the demonetisation of all money in circulation by th every fact of its employment as an instrument of circulation.* The case of inconvertible fiat money is no different from that of coins: both involve the general problem of *reconciling the first two functions of money*."
- de Brunhoff p. 37
