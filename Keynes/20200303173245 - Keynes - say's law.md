From the time of Say and Ricardo the classical economists have taught that supply creates its own demand;  â€”meaning by this in some significant, but not clearly  defined, sense that the whole of the costs of production  must necessarily be spent in the aggregate, directly or  indirectly, on purchasing the product
(Keynes - General Theory, p.40)

*The insanity of this perspective is that it would essentially presuppose an entirely closed economy - how could new value possibly be created in this environment? Something always has to come from elsewhere, from outside the realm of circulation - whether it is human creative action, stolen resources, or credit.
