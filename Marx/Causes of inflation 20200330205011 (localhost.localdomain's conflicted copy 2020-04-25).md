# A taxonomy of theories of inflation


There are essentially two main theories for explaining inflation and deflation - the quantity theory of money, and everything else, but having said that, these are not necessarily the same thing as saying that money is either neutral or not neutral.

**Endogenous theories of inflation:** Inflation occurs because of mechanisms happening in the economy - e.g. increases in the production cost of commodities.

**Exogenous theories of inflation:** Inflation occurs because of changes to the money supply. Monetarism and QTM contain exogenous theories of inflation.


## Marxist explanations of inflation

### Under commodity money

#### Changes in the value of the money-commodity

1. **Deflation *changes in the value of the money-commodity:*** If the SNLT required to produce the money-commodity increases (for instance, due to having exhausted easily accessed mine), then the value of the money-commodity will increase relative to other commodities, with two caveats:
            * There has to be sufficient time for the change in value at the point at which the money-commodity enters the economy to filter through the rest of the economy and;
            * There has to be enough demand for additional money-commodity to bring those mines online in the first place
2. **Inflation - *changes in the value of the money-commodity*** If the SNLT required to produce the money commodity *decreases* then the relative value of the money-commodity will fall (given enough time for effects to filter through from point of entry into the economy.)

#### Changes in the value of other commodities

1. **Deflation:** If the SNLT required to produce other commodities falls, then a given amount of the money-commodity will exchange for more of those commodities. This would appear as a general price deflation across the economy.
2. **Inflation:** If the SNLT required to produce other commodities increases, then a given amount of the money-commodity will exchange for fewer of those commodities. This would appear as general price inflation across the economy, after a certain lag.


#### Changes in the velocity of circulation

> "If the aggregate prices of the commodities in circulation rise, but to a smaller extent than the velocity of currency increases, then the volume of money in circulation will decrease. If, on the contrary, the velocity of circulation decreases at a faster rate than the total price of the commodities in circulation, then the volume of money in circulation will grow. A general fall in prices accompanied by an increase in the quantity of the medium of circulation and a general rise in prices accompanied by a decrease in the quantity of the medium of circulation are among the best documented phenomena in the history of prices. But the causes occasioning a rise in the level of prices and at the same time an even larger rise in the velocity of currency, as also the converse development, lie outside the scope of an investigation into simple circulation. We may mention by way of illustration that in periods of expanding credit the velocity of currency increases faster than the prices of commodities, whereas in periods of contracting credit the velocity of currency declines faster than the prices of commodities"

Importantly - this means that credit may mean an increase in the velocity of currency reading credit as an extension of funds on the basis of the idea that funds are in the process of returning to the banker at a certain velocity, which would cause 


#### Operation of inflation under symbolic money

> "Worthless tokens become tokens of value only when they represent gold within the process of circulation, and they represent it only to the amount of gold which would circulate as coin, an amount which depends on the value of gold if the exchange value of the commodities an the velocity of their metamorphoses are given. The number of pieces of paper with a denomination of £5 which could be used in circulation would be one-fifth of the number of pieces of paper with a denomination of £1, and if all payments were to be transacted in shilling notes, then twenty times more shilling notes than pound notes would have to circulate.   If gold coin were represented by notes of different denomination, e.g. £5 notes,   £1 notes and 10s. notes, the number of the different types of tokens of value needed would not just be determined by the quantity of gold required in the sphere of circulation as a whole, but by the quantity needed in the sphere of circulation of each particular type of note. If £14 million were the level below which the circulation of a country never fell (this is the presupposition of English Banking legislation, not however with regard to coin but to credit money), then 14 million pieces of paper, each a token of value representing £1, could circulate. If the value of gold decreased or increased because the labour time required for its production had fallen or risen, then the number of pound notes in circulation would increase or decrease in inverse ration to the change in the value of gold, provided the exchange value of the same mass of commodities remained unchanged. Supposing gold were superseded by silver as the standard of value and the relative value of silver to gold were 1 : 15, then 210 million pound notes would have to circulate henceforth instead of 14 million, if from now on each piece of paper was to represent the same amount of silver as it had previously represented of gold. The number of pieces of paper is thus determined by the quantity of gold currency which they represent in circulation, and as they are tokens of value only in so far as they take the place of gold currency, their value is simply determined by their    quantity. Whereas, therefore, the quantity of gold in circulation depends on the prices of commodities, the value of the paper in circulation, on the other hand, depends solely on its own quantity."
- ZK 353

*A certain amount of paper is needed to represent a certain amount of gold, based on the nominal value of that paper. Beyond that, quantity does affect the value of symbolic tokens. So, QTM does not apply to gold, but in a way can apply to paper money, but importantly within the framework in which paper money represents gold.*

> "The intervention of the State which issues paper money with  a legal rate of exchange—and we speak only of this type of paper money—seems to invalidate the economic law. The State, whose mint price merely provided a definite weight of gold with a name and whose mint merely imprinted its stamp on gold, seems now to transform paper into gold by the magic of its imprint. Because the pieces of paper have a legal rate of exchange, it is impossible to prevent the State from thrusting any arbitrarily chosen number of them into circulation and to imprint them at   will with any monetary denomination such as £1, £5, or £20. Once the note are in circulation it is impossible to drive them out, for the frontiers of the country limit their movement, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, they lose all value, both use value and exchange value,  outside the sphere of circulation. Apart from their function they are useless scraps of paper. But this power of the State is mere illusion. It may throw any number of paper notes of any denomination into circulation but its control ceases with this mechanical act. As soon as the token of value or paper money enters the sphere of circulation it i s subject to the inherent laws of this sphere."


"Let us assume that £14 million is the amount of gold required for the circulation of commodities and that the State throws 210 million notes each called £1 into circulation: these 210 million would then stand for a total of gold worth £14 million. The effect would be the same as if the notes issued by the State were to represent a metal whose value was one-fifteenth that of gold or that each note was intended to represent one-fifteenth of the previous weight of gold. This would have changed nothing but the nomenclature of the standard of prices, which is of course purely conventional, quite irrespective of whether it was brought about directly by  a change in the monetary standard or indirectly by  a increase in the number of paper notes issued in accordance with  a new lower standard. As the name pound sterling would now indicate one-fifteenth of the previous quantity of gold, all commodity prices would be fifteen times higher and 210 million pound notes would now be indeed just as necessary as 14 million had previously been. The decrease in the quantity of gold which each individual token of value represented would be proportional to the increased aggregate value of these tokens. The rise of prices would be merely a reaction of the process of circulation, which forcibly placed the tokens of value on a par with the quantity of gold which they are supposed to replace in the sphere of circulation."
- ZK 354

"One finds a number of occasions in the history of the debasement of currency by English and French governments when the rise in prices was not proportionate to the debasement of the silver coins. The reason was simply that the increase in the volume of currency was not proportional to its debasement; in other words, if the exchange value of commodities was in future to be evaluated in terms of the lower standard of value and to be realised in coins corresponding to this lower standard, then inadequate number of coins with lower metal content had been issued. This is the solution of the difficulty which was not resolved by the controversy between Locke and Lowndes. The rate at which a token of value—whether it consists of paper or bogus gold and silver is quite irrelevant—can take the place of definite quantities of gold and silver calculated according to the mint price depends on the number of tokens in circulation and by no means on the material of which they are made. The difficulty in grasping this relation is due to the fact that the two functions of money—as  a standard of value and a medium of circulation—are governed not only by conflicting laws, but by laws which appear to be at variance with the antithetical features of the two functions. [As regards its function3] as a standard of value, when money serves solely as money of account and gold merely as nominal gold, it is the physical material used which is the crucial factor. Exchange values expressed in terms of silver, or as silver prices, look of course quite different from exchange values expressed in terms of gold, or as gold prices. On the other hand, when it functions as   a medium of circulation, when money is not just imaginary but must be present as a real thing side by side with other commodities, its material is irrelevant and its quantity becomes the crucial factor. Although whether it is a pound of gold, of silver or of copper is decisive for the standard measure, mere number makes the coin an adequate embodiment of any of these standard measures, quite irrespective of its own material. But it is at variance with common sense that in the case of purely imaginary money everything should depend on the physical substance, whereas in the case of the corporeal coin everything should depend on a numerical relation that is nominal."
- ZK 355

*Note that here when he talks about money as purely imaginary and as the standard of account he is talking about measuring value, which requires gold.*


"The rise or fall of commodity prices corresponding to an increase or decrease in the volume of paper notes—the latter where paper notes are the sole medium of circulation—is accordingly merely a forcible assertion by the process of circula-tion of a law which was mechanically infringed by extraneous action; i.e. the law that the quantity of gold in circulation is determined by the prices of commodities and the volume of tokens of value in circulation is determined by the amount of gold currency which they replace in circulation. The circulation process will, on the other hand, absorb or as it were digest any number of paper notes, since, irrespective of the gold tide borne by the token of value when entering circulation, it is compressed to a token of the quantity of gold which could circulate instead."

- ZK 355


"In the circulation of tokens of value all the laws governing the circulation of real money seem to be reversed and turned upside down. Gold circulates because it has value, whereas paper has value because it circulates.  If the exchange value of commodities is given, the quantity of gold in circulation depends on its value, whereas the value of paper tokens depends on the number of tokens in circulation. The amount of gold in circulation increases or decreases with the rise or fall of commodity prices, whereas commodity prices seem to rise or fall with the changing amount of paper in circulation. The circulation of commodities can absorb only a certain quantity of gold currency, the alternating contrac-tion and expansion of the volume of money in circulation manifesting itself accordingly as an inevitable law, whereas any amount of paper money seems to be absorbed by circulation."
- ZK 356

"The gold coin obviously represents the value of commodities only after the value has been assessed in terms of gold or expressed as a price, whereas the token of value seems to represent the value of commodities directly"
- ZK 356

*thus it is easy for fetishisation to take hold***

"These laws indeed appear not only to be turned upside down in the circulation of tokens of value but even annulled; for the movements of paper money, when it is issued in the appropriate amount, are not characteristic of it as token of value, whereas its specific movements are due to infringements of its correct proportion to gold, and do not directly arise from the metamorphosis of commodities."
- ZK 356

> "Let us for a moment consider the commodity gold, that is money, in a state of rest and its relations with other commodities. All prices of commodities signify definite amounts of gold; they are thus merely notional gold or notional money, i.e.  symbols of gold, just as, on the other hand, money considered as a token of value appeared to be merely a symbol of the prices of commodities.* Since all commodities are therefore merely notional money, money is the only real commodity. Gold is   the  material aspect  of  abstract  wealth in contradistinction to commodities which only represent the independent form of exchange value, of universal social labour and of abstract wealth. So far as use value is concerned, each commodity represents only one element of physical wealth, only one separate facet of wealth, through its relation to a particular need. But money satisfies any need since it can be immediately turned into the object of any need. Its own use value is realised in the endless series of use values which constitute its equivalents. All the physical wealth evolved in the world of commodities is contained in a latent state in this solid piece of metal. Thus whereas the prices of commodities represent gold, the universal equivalent or abstract wealth, the use value of gold represents the use value of all commodities. Gold is, therefore, the  material   symbol  of  physical  wealth. It is the   précis  de  toutes  les choses"3 (Boisguillebert), the compendium of social wealth. As regards its form, it is the direct incarnation of universal labour, and as regards its content the quintessence of all concrete labour. I t is universal wealth in an individual form.** Functioning as  a medium of circulation, gold suffered all manner of injuries, it was clipped and even reduced to a purely symbolical scrap of paper. Its golden splendour is restored when it serves as money."
- ZK 358

> "The coin itself becomes money as soon as its movement is interrupted. In the hands of the seller who receives it in return for a commodity it is money, and not coin; but when it leaves his hands it becomes a coin once more."
- ZK 359

Money at rest, coin in motion.

# Mandel's summary of causes of inflation

> (a) A fall in the average productivity of labour in a given branch of output   (for example, in certain agricultural or mining branches, where a decline   in natural fertility is not completely offset by technological progress);   prices would then rise as the result of an increase in value of particular   commodities (i.e. in the quantity of social labour necessary for their   production).   (b) A sudden increase of labour productivity in the gold-mining industry   (and thus a decline in the value of gold); all other things remaining   equal, the same mass of commodities would then be exchanged for a   greater amount of gold (produced by the same quantity of labour as   before). In other words, the gold price of commodities would rise.   (c) An upward trend of market price-fluctuations around an unchanged   axis of values. This may occur, even when the gold currency remains   stable and when there is no paper money inflation, at that precise stage   of the trade cycle marked by the periodic contraction of the hoarded   part of money as compared to the circulating part.   (d) An inflationary movement of money signs. In this case, a constant   amount of gold, which exchanges against the same amount of com-  modities as before on the basis of an unaltered quantity of socially   necessary labour, becomes represented by a greater sum of paper money   signs (or of bank money, credit money).115

#### Questions

___
`Questions:- does this mean that increased wages will potentially cause inflation by increasing the snlt required to produce commodities, assuming that technological change does not eliminate the net gain to workers?`
___

### Under symbolic money

Symbolic money perhaps hews more closely to the dynamics described by the quantity theory?
