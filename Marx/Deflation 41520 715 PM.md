Deflation 4/15/20 7:15 PM
========================

Deflation is an issue because:

1. The amount of commodities increases, but the amount of HPM (gold) stays the same.
2. Therefore, relative values adjust. Gold can now buy more commodities. Although the labour value of gold stays the same a combination of two things occurs - 1. we can assume that if there are more commodities the SNLT required to produce them has fallen somewhat, and 2. gold's relative value has adjusted.
3. However, while the measure of value changes, the standard of price does not.
4. Therefore - the nominal terms of prices fall to enable the amount of commodities to be made commensurate with the mass of gold.
5. To an individual participant in the economy - this makes it seem that they are being shortchanged.
6. In reality - all prices are falling to some extent to adjust to this new relative value equation. But, the individual does not necessarily take this into account in their decisionmaking. They are not aware of the macro picture, only that what they perceive to be money - currency branded in the standard of price - appears to be more 'scarce' and that they are having to lower their prices as a result.
7. This then leads to a change in expectations - they may stop investing, etc because they believe they cannot afford to.


Is it  a contradiction that commodities get cheaper over time - which is deflation, but deflation decreases the value of debt, which is what is used to produce commodities?
