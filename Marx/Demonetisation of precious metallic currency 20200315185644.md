Demonetisation is a historical, not a conceptual process. It is the process by which coins in circulation begin to weigh less than their face value indicates. This begins to separate the measure of value from the standard of price.

> "Minted into coins and transformed into currency, gold can, in circulating, demonetize itself; it loses its weight of metal and becomes the shadow of its own metallic substance. This loss of its matter explains the difference between the "monetary price" and the "market price" of gold; the public mint always produces coins according to the same standard but the pieces in circulation, used and clipped, weigh less than their name indicates. Having become lighter, they only correspond to a smaller quantity of gold, and themonetary price is less than the market price for the same quantity. "The weight of gold fixed upon as the standard of prices deviates from the weight that serves as the circulating medium, and the latter therbey ceases any longer to be a real equivalent of the commodities whose prices it realizes""

- de Brunhoff, Marx on Money, p. 32

> "Nevertheless, this demonetization of the currency does not detract from the dependence of the instrument of circulation on the true value of the gold. The quantity which actually circulates remains distinct from the total quantity of gold, and the course of its circulation continues to be determined by the value relationships between money as general equivalent and the prices of commodities. The modification of the coins affects only the special form of the medium of circulation."

- de Brunhoff, Marx on Money, p. 32
