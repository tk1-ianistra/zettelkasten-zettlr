"However, of all these forms, the most complete fetish is interest-bearing capital. This is the original
starting-point of capital—money—and the formula M—C—M' is reduced to its two extremes—M—
M'—money which creates more money. It is the original and general formula of capital reduced to a
meaningless résumé."
- TSV Addenda p. 1111

Capital, insofar as it appears in the circulation process, confronts the ordinary observer mainly in
the form of merchant capital, that is, a kind of capital which is engaged only in this operation, hence
profit in this field is in part linked with a vague notion of general swindling, or more specifically,
with the idea that the merchant swindles the industrial capitalist in the same way as the industrial
capitalist swindles the worker, or again that the merchant swindles the consumer, just as the
producers swindle one another. In any case, profit here is explained as a result of exchange, that is,
as arising from a social relation and not from a thing.
- 1112


On the other hand, interest-bearing capital is the perfect fetish. It is capital in its finished form—as
such representing the unity of the production process and the circulation process—and therefore
yields a definite profit in a definite period of time. In the form of interest—bearing capital only this
function remains, without the mediation of either production process or circulation process.
Memories of the past still remain in capital and profit, although because of the divergence of profit
from surplus-value and the uniform profit yielded by all capitals—that is, the general rate of profit—
capital becomes ||892| very much obscured, something dark and mysterious.

Since, on the basis of capitalist production, a certain sum of values represented in money or
commodities—actually in money, the converted form of the commodity—makes it possible to extract
a certain amount of labour gratis from the workers and to appropriate a certain amount of surplus-
value, surplus labour, surplus product, it is obvious that money itself can be sold as capital, that is, as
a commodity sui generis, or that capital can be bought in the form of commodities or of money.
-1112

It can be sold as the source of profit. I enable someone else by means of money, etc., to appropriate
surplus-value. Thus it is quite in order for me to receive part of this surplus-value. Just as land has
value because it enables me to intercept a portion of surplus-value, and I therefore pay for this land
only the surplus-value which can be intercepted thanks to it, so I pay for capital the surplus-value
which is created by means of it. Since, in the capitalist production process, the value of capital is
perpetuated and reproduced in addition to its surplus-value, it is therefore quite in order that, when
money or commodities are sold as capital, they return to the seller after a period of time and he does
not alienate it [capital] in the same way as he would a commodity but retains ownership of it. In this
way, money or commodities are not sold as money or commodities, but in their second power, as capital, as self-increasing money or commodities. Capital is not only increased, but is preserved in
the total process of production. It therefore remains capital for the seller and comes back to him. The
sale consists in the fact that another person, who uses the capital as productive capital, has to pay its
owner a certain part of his profit, which he only makes through this capital. Like land, it is rented out
as a value-creating thing which in this process of generating value is preserved and continually
returned, and therefore can also be returned to the original seller. It is only capital in virtue of its
return to him. Otherwise he would sell it as a commodity or buy with it as money.

-1112-3

In any case, the form considered in itself (in fact, it [money] is alienated periodically as a means for
exploiting labour, for making surplus-value) is this, that the thing now appears as capital and capital
appears as a mere thing; the whole result of the capitalist production and circulation process appears
as a property inherent in a thing, and it depends on the owner of money, i.e., of the commodity in its
constantly exchangeable form, whether he expends it as money or rents it out as capital.
-1113

##### There has always been conflict between financial and industrial capitalists for supremacy

It is thus clear why superficial criticism—in exactly the same way as it wants to maintain
commodities and combats money—now turns its wisdom and reforming zeal against interest-bearing
capital without touching upon real capitalist production, but merely attacking one of its
consequences. This polemic against interest-bearing capital, undertaken from the standpoint of
capitalist production, a polemic which today parades as “socialism”, occurs, incidentally, as a phase
in the development of capital itself, for example, in the seventeenth century, when the industrial
capitalist had to assert himself against the old-fashioned usurer who, at that time, still [confronted]
him as a superior power.
-1113


In the real production process of capital, each particular movement of money expresses an aspect of
reproduction, whether it be the conversion of money into labour, the conversion of the finished
commodity into money (the end of the act of production) or the reconversion of the money into
commodities (renewal of the production process, recommencement of reproduction). The movement
of money when it is lent as capital, that is, when it is not converted into capital but enters into
circulation as capital, expresses nothing more than the transfer of the same money from one person to
another. The property rights remain with the lender, but the possession is transferred to the industrial
capitalist. For the lender, however, the conversion of the money into capital begins at the moment
when he spends it as capital instead of spending it as money, i.e., when he hands it over to the
industrial capitalist. (It remains capital for him even if he does not lend it to the industrial capitalist
but to a spendthrift, or to a worker who cannot pay his rent. The whole pawnshop business [is based
on this].) True, the other person converts it into capital, but this is an operation beyond that in which
the lender and the borrower are involved. This development is effaced, is not visible, is not directly
included in it. Instead of the real conversion of money into capital, there appears only the empty form
of this process. Just as in the case of labour-power, the use-value of money here becomes that of
creating exchange-value, more exchange-value than it itself contains. It is lent as self-expanding
value, as a commodity, but a commodity which, precisely because of this quality, differs from
commodities as such and therefore also possesses a specific form of alienation.


**What is happening when a debt is sold is just that capital is changing owners**

 Interest, as distinct from profit, represents the value of mere ownership of capital—i.e., it
transforms the ownership of money (of a sum of values, commodities, whatever the form may be) in
itself, into ownership of capital, and consequently commodities or money as such into self-expanding
values. The conditions of labour are of course capital, only insofar as they confront the labourer as
his non-property and consequently function as someone else’s property. But they can function in this
way only in contradiction to labour. The antagonistic existence of these conditions in relation to
labour makes their owners capitalists, and turns these conditions owned by them into capital. But
capital in the hands of moneyed capitalist A does not have this contradictory character which turns it

 But money as money—before its conversion into and its function
as capital, a function which it does not perform while it is in the hands of the moneylender—has no
other use-value than that which it possesses as a commodity (gold, silver, its material substance) or
as money which is the converted form of a commodity. What the moneylender sells in actual fact to
the industrial capitalist, what really happens in the transaction, is simply this: he transfers the
ownership of the money to the industrial capitalist for a certain period of time. He disposes of his
ownership title for a certain term, and as a result the industrial capitalist has bought the ownership for
a certain period. Thus his money appears to be capital before it is sold and the mere ownership of
money or a commodity—separated from the capitalist production process—is regarded as capital.

*The point being made here is that the money is not capital in the hands of the moneylender, it is a commodity, the use-value of which is that it can be exchanged for all other commodities (see K1 [The emergence and role of symbolic money 20200329164631](The%20emergence%20and%20role%20of%20symbolic%20money%2020200329164631.md)) - as a commodity with a particular use-value it is sold to the industrial capitalist, in whose hands it becomes capital by being converted into labour time and the means of production, and completing a full cycle of reproduction, before then undertaking a movement back to the hands of the money-lender. The work of the money-lender, therefore, is not productive work in and of itself. It is circulatory work that does not create value. It may play a valuable role in a particular historical and technological configuration of capitalism, but it does not create value. The way its movements are obscured in these relations gives it, however, the appearance of creating value.""

The fact that it becomes capital only after it has been disposed of, makes no difference, any more thanthe use-value of cotton is altered by the fact that its use-value only emerges after it has been disposedof to the spinner or that the use-value of meat only becomes apparent after it has been transferred fromthe butcher’s shop to the consumer’s table. Hence money, once it is not spent on consumption, andcommodities, once they are not used as means of consumption by their owners, transform those whopossess them into capitalists and are in themselves—separated from the capitalist production processand even before their conversion into “productive” capital—capital, that is, they are selfexpanding,self-maintaining and self-increasing value. It is their immanent attribute to create value, to yieldinterest, just as the attribute of the pear tree is to produce pears. And it is as such an interest-bearingthing that the money-lender sells his money to the industrial capitalist. Because money preservesitself, i.e., is value which preserves itself, the industrial capitalist can return it at any time fixed bycontract. Since it produces a definite amount of surplus-value, interest, annually, or rather since valueaccrues to it over any period of time, he can also pay back this surplus-value to the lender annually orin any other conventionally established period of time. Money as capital yields surplus-value daily inexactly the same way as wage-labour. While interest is simply a part of the profit established undera special name, it appears here as [the surplus-value specifically created by] capital as such,separated from the production process, and consequently [due] only to the mere ownership of capital,the ownership of money and commodities, separated from the relations which give rise to thecontradiction between this property and labour, thus turning it into capitalist property. [Interest seemsto be] a specific kind of surplus-value the generation of which is due to the mere ownership ofcapital and therefore to an intrinsic characteristic of capital; whereas on the contrary, industrialprofit appears to be a mere addition which the borrower obtains by employing capital productively,that is, by exploiting the workers with the help of the capital borrowed (or, as people also say, by hiswork as a capitalist, the function of the capitalist being equated here with labour, and even identifiedwith wage-labour, since the industrial capitalist, by really taking part in the ||896| production process,appears in fact as an active agent in production, as a worker, in contrast to the idle, inactivemoneylender whose function of property owner is separate from and outside the production process).

"Thus it is interest, not profit, which appears to be the creation of value arising from capital as suchand therefore from the mere ownership of capital; consequently it is regarded as the specific revenuecreated by capital. This is also the form in which it is conceived by the vulgar economists. In thisform all intermediate links are obliterated, and the fetishistic feature of capital, as also the concept ofthe capital-fetish, is complete. This form arises necessarily, because the juridical aspect of propertyis separated from its economic aspect and one part of the profit under the name of interest accrues tocapital which is completely separated from the production process, or to the owner of this capital." - 1117


- 
To the vulgar economist who desires to represent capital as an independent source of value, a sourcewhich creates value, this form is of course a godsend, a form in which the source of profit is nolonger recognisable and the result of the capitalist process—separated from the process itself—acquires an independent existence. In M—C—M' an intermediate link is still retained. In M—M' wehave the incomprehensible form of capital, the most extreme inversion and materialisation ofproduction relations.
- 1117


What the lender demands of the capitalist is calculated on the general (average) rate of profit,not on individual deviations from it. Here the average becomes the pre-condition. The rate ofinterest itself varies, but does so for all borrowers.
- 1117
*This may be an explanation for the decline of interest rates around advanced economies - it is tied to the tendency for the long term rate of profit to fall.*

"This is not the place to go into the reasons for this greater stability and equality of the rate of interest
on loan capital in contradistinction to the less tangible form of the general rate of profit. Such a
discussion belongs to the section on credit."
- 1118
- *do we say that the interest rate (which is not actually as static as made out here) is more stable than the rate of profit because it is based on the average rate of profit all aggregated capital is expected to achieve.*

"One can see that all this involves a very complex movement in which, on the one hand, the marketprices in each particular sphere, the relative cost-prices of the different commodities, the positionwith regard to demand and supply within each individual sphere, and, on the other hand, competitionamong the capitalists in the different spheres, play a part, and, in addition, the speed of theequalisation process, whether it is quicker or slower, depends on the particular organic compositionof the different capitals (more fixed or circulating capital, for example) and on the particular nature oftheir commodities, that is, whether their nature as use-values facilitates rapid withdrawal from themarket and the diminution or increase of supply, in accordance with the level of the market prices." - 118

"Just as the marketprices of commodities fluctuate daily, which does not prevent them from being quoted daily, so it iswith the rate of interest, which is likewise quoted regularly as the price of money. This is theestablished price of capital, for capital is here offered as a special kind of commodity—money—andconsequently its market price is established in the same way as that of all other commodities. Therate of interest is therefore always expressed as the general rate of interest, as a fixed amount [to bepaid] for a certain amount of money; whereas the rate of profit within a particular sphere may varyalthough the market prices of commodities are the same (depending on the conditions under whichindividual capitals produce the same commodities; since the individual rate of profit does not dependon the market price of the commodity but on the difference between the market price and the cost-price) and it is equalised in the different spheres in the course of operations only as a result ofconstant fluctuations. In short, only in moneyed capital, the capital which can be lent, does capitalbecome a commodity, whose quality of self-expansion has a fixed price, which is quoted as theprevailing rate of interest." - 1119
*the rate of interest as the 'price' of capital as a commodity*

"This aspect of capital, which is the most fantastic and at the same time comes nearest to the popularnotion of it, is both regarded as the “basic form” by the vulgar economists and made the first point ofattack by superficial critics; the former, partly because the inner connections are least apparent hereand capital emerges in a form in which it appears to be an independent source of value, partlybecause its contradictory character is totally concealed and effaced in this form and no contradictionto labour [is evident]. On the other hand, [capital is subjected to] attack because it is the form inwhich it is at its most irrational and provides the easiest point of attack for the vulgar socialists." - 1120
