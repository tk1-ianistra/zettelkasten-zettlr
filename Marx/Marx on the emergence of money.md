# Money emerges from commodities

> "The principal difficulty in the analysis of money is surmounted as soon as it is understood that the commodity is **the origin*** of money. After that it is only a question of clearly comprehending the specific form peculiar to it. This is not so easy because all bourgeois relations appear to be gilded, i.e., they appear to be money relations, and the money form, therefore, seems to possess an infinitely varied content, which is quite alien to this form."
- ZK p. 39 (emphasis is mine)

This is an important clarification because it speaks to a common misunderstanding of Marx as a 'metallist', or as somehow being a believer in the gold standard, which of course, as evidenced by his derision of Peel's bank act, he is not. Marx knew that Peels' bank act would be ultimately incompatible with capitalism because it would accentuate the contradiction between the commodity origins of money and capitalism's demand for money without deflation.

Money *emerges from* commodities - that is, it initially derives its role as money from being a commodity. That does not mean it doesn't continue to evolve from there, but it's important to understand that it emerges from money to understand how it functions later - particularly because it reinforces for us that the idea of money as an imagined social contract created by conscious human design is historical revisionism - money has *evolved*, not been designed.


## Money is an evolution of the value-form of the 'universal equivalent'

#### Simple form

#### Expanded form

#### The general equivalent

The universal/general equivalent is a commodity that is used to relate the value of all other commodities.

#### The money form

1. The money form is what happens when the universal/general equivalent becomes, by social custom or fiat, entwined with a particular commodity.
2. The money form can only be the money form because it was once a commodity.
    3. "Gold confronts the other commodities as money only because it previously confronted them as a commodity." - p. 162

> "Money necessarily crystallizes out of the process of exchange, in which different products of labour -are in fact equated with each other, and thus converted into commodities. The historical broadening and deepening of the phenomenon of exchange develops the opposition between use-value and value which is latent in the nature of the commodity. The need to give an external expression to this opposition for the purposes of commercial intercourse produces the drive towards an independent form of value, which finds neither rest nor peace until an independent form has been achieved by the differentiation of commodities into commodities and money. At the same rate, then, as the transformation of the products of labour into commodities is accomplished, one _particular commodity is transformed into money.4 The direct exchange of products has the form of the simple" - K1 p. 181

In a pre-monetary scenario, how would you determine commensurability? What would inform your willingness to trade a certain amount of one commodity for a certain amount of another… presumably how easily you could produce the commodity you stood to gain yourself, e.g. the labour time required.

As discussed above,  money is initially a particular formalisation of the universal equivalent. This is commodity money.

Gold is like any other commodity.

It derives its exchange vlaue from SNLT – it is quite difficult to mine, therefore relatively high SNLT. It is adopted as the universal exchange because of its physical properties – doesn’t rust or erode, uniform and infinitely divisible. Therefore, an amount of gold is a commodity in proportion to all other commodities just as linen would be, except linen decays and therefore is not practical.

Money fetishism emerges because the process of actually relating one commodity to gold, to all other commodities disappears. It seems as if gold, when pulled out of the earth, is inherently everything all at once, the process is lost. Money is fetishised. “The physical object, gold or silver, in its crude state, becomes, immediately on its emergence from the bowels of the earth, the direct incarnation of all human labour. Hence the magic of money.”

This is only possible because of commodity fetishism, which is in turn only possible because exchange obscures social relations of production, which is only possible because of exchange value and use value contradiction.

## Money emerges initially as exchange relations develop between different societies during petty commodity production

> "The universal equivalent form comes and goes with the m ome ntary social contacts which call it into existence. It is transiently attached to this or that commodity in alternation. But with th e development of exchange it fixes itself firmly and exclusively onto particular kinds of commodity, i.e. it crystallizes out into the money-form. The particular kind of commodity to which it sticks is at fi rst a matter of accident. Nevertheless there are two circumstances which are by and large decis ive. The money-form comes to be attached either to the most important articles of exchange from outside, which are in fact the primitive and spontaneous forms of manifestation of the exchange-value of local products, or to the object of utility which forms the chief element of. in• digenous alienable wealth, for example cattle. Nomadic p�ople_s are the fi rst to develop the money-form, because all their worldly p ossessions are in a movable and therefore directly ai lenable form, and because their mode of life, by continually bringfng them into contact with foreign communities, encourages the exchange of products."
 - K1 p. 183

**There is something to do with the fact that the money-commodity emerges in interactions between groups...how does Marx's discussion of the emergence of commodity money re: early civilisations relate to the concept of world money?**

*"In the same proportion as exchange bursts its local bonds, and the value of commodities accordingly expands more and more into the material embodiment of human labour as such, in that pro­ portion does the money-form become transferred to commodities · which are by nature fitted to perform the social function ofauni­ versal equivalent. Those commodities are the precious metals."* - K1. p. 183

Money aquires a a dual-use value - the original use value the commodity possessed, and the 'formal use value' it absorbs as a result of its adoption as the universal equivalent.

**Utterly critical is the realisation that money begins as a commodity**:

"We have seen that the money-form i s merely the reflection thrown upon a single commodity by the relations between_all other commodities. That money is a commodity is therefore only a discovery for those who proceed from its finished shape in order to analyse it afterwards. The process of exchange gives to the commodity which it has converted into money not its value but its specific value-form. Confusion between these two attributes has misled some writers into maintaining that the value of gold and silver is imaginary. The fact that money can, in certain functions, be replaced by mere symbols of itself, gave rise to another mistaken notion that it is itself a mere symbol." - K1 p. 185-6

**Its value is determined by SNLT, like any commodity:**

"Money, like every other commodity, cannot express the magnitude of its value except relatively in other commodities. This value is determined by the labour-time required for its production, and is expressed in the quantity of any other commodity in wich the same amount of labour-time is congealed." - K1 p. 186

"We have already seen; from the simplest expression of value, x commodity A = y commodity B, that the thing in which the magnitude of the value of another thing is represented appears to -  --  have the equivalent form independently of this relation, as a social property inherent in its nature. We followed the process by which · ··-··· thi  s false semblance became firmlye�tablished, a process which was completed when the universal equivalent form became identified with the natural form of a particular commodity, and thus crystal­ lized into the money-form. What appears to happen is not that a p articular commodity become:; money because all other com­ m odities express their values in it, but, on the contrary, that all other commodities universally express their values in a particular commodity because it is money. The movement through which this process has been mediated vanishes in its own result, leaving 110 trace behind. Without any initiative on their part, the com­ modities find their own value-configuration ready to hand, in the form of a physical commodity existing outside but also alongside them. This physical object, gold or silver in its crude state , becomes, immediately on its emergence from the bowels of the · earth, the direct incarnation of all human labour. Hence the magic .ofmoney. Men are henceforth related to each other in their social process of production in a purely atomistic way. Their own . relations of production therefore assume a material shape which 1s , independent of their control and their conscious individual action. This situation is manifested first by the fact that the pro­ ducts of men's labour universally take on the form of commodities. The riddle of the money fetish is therefore the riddle of the com­ modity fetish, now become visible and dazzling to our eyes." - K1 p. 187

*Read Marx's attack on Owen - the idea of 'ticket' forms of money*


## Variability in value is inherent to money - obeys the normal laws of SNLT

1. The commodity of money needs to exist to measure value. Measurement of value enables expression of price. Expression of price is just a formalised, common way of articulating the measurement of value. It puts a particular unit to something that has been made 'knowable', measurable.

2. Therefore - once the standard of price has been established the money-commodity does not need to be present to actually enable a price to be set, or even paid necessarily, but without the commodity existing in an initial sense the standard of price cannot exist.

3. **Variability in value is inherent to the use of a commodity as money, but the variability of the measure of value undermines the certainty of the standard of price**

*"As measure of value, and as standard of price, money performs two quite different functions. It is the measure of value as the social incarnation of human labour ; it is the standard of price as a quantity of metal with a fixed weight. As the measure of value it serves to convert the values of all the manifold commodities into prices, into imaginary quantities of gold ; as the standard of price it measures those quantities of gold. The measure of values measures commodities considered as values ; the standard of price measures, on the contrary, quantities of gold by a unit quantity of gold, not the value of one quan tity of gold by the weight of another. For the standard of price, a certain weight of gold must be fixed as the unit of measurement. In this case, as in all cases where quantities of the same denomination are to be measured, the stability of the measurement is of decisive importance. Hence the less the unit of measurement (here a quantity of gold) is subject to variation, the better the standard of price fulfils its office. But gold can serve as a measure of value only because it is itself a product of labour, and therefore potentially variable in value. 6 It is, first of all, quite clear that a change in the value of gold in"* - K1 p. 192


> "and therefore potentially variable in value. 6 It is, first of all, quite clear that a change in the value of gold in no way impairs its function as a standard of price. No matter how the value of gold varies, different quantities of gold always remain in the same value-relation to each other. If the value of gold fell by 1 , 000 per cent, 12 ounces of gold would continue to have twelve times the value of one ounce of gold, and when we are dealing with prices we are only concerned with the relation between different quantities of gold. Since, on the other hand, an ounce of gold undergoes no change in weight when its value rises or falls, no-  change can take place i n the weight of its aliquot parts. Thus gold always renders the same service as a fixed measure of price, how­ ever much its value may vary. Moreover, a change in the value of . ---gold does not prevent it from fulfilling its function as measure of value. The change affects all commodities simultaneously, and therefore, other things being equal, leaves the mutual relations between their values unaltered, although those values are now all expressed in higher or lower gold-prices than before. Just as in the case of the estimation of the value of a com" - K1 p. 192-3

> A general rise in the prices of commodities can result either from a rise in their values, which happens when the value of money remains constant, or from a fall in the value of money, which happens when the values of commodities remain constant. The process also occurs in reverse : a general fall in prices can result either from a fall in the values of commodities, if the value of money : )"em ains constant, or from a rise in the value of money, if the values of commodities remain constant. It therefore by no means follows that a rise in the value of money necessarily implies a proportional fall in the prices of commodities, or that a fall in the value of money implies a proportional rise in prices. This would hold only for commodities whose value remains constant. But commodities whose value rises simultaneously with and in proportion to that of money w ould retain the same price. And if their .value rose either slower or faster than that of money, the fall or rise in their prices : would be determined by the difference between the path described by their value and that described by the value of money. And so on." - K1 p. 193

**Inflation can occur therefore when the value of money falls or the value of all commodities rises proportional to the money commodity**

This is completely different to the process of debasement/demonetisation. Here we're talking about the actual value of an ounce of gold falling, such that previously an ounce of gold might have equalled 10 bushels of wheat, and now an ounce of gold equals 8 bushels of wheat. In both cases you still have an once of gold, but it relates to commodities in different ways.

The process of debasement/demonetisation, however involves coming to exchange with an ounce of gold that is not actually an ounce of gold. It involves attempting to present oneself as having a quantity of gold that is equivalent to the value of either 8 or 10 (or 100) bushels of wheat, but actually having only half an ounce, but stamped with a label saying "1 ounce" - it is asking the other party to abide by the standard of price when the standard of price no longer accurately reflects the measure of value.

> "The name o f a thing is entirely external to its nature. I know nothing of a man if l merely know his name is Jacob. In the same way, every trace of the money-relation disappears in the moneynames pound, thaler, franc, ducat, etc. The confusion caused by attributing a hidden meaning to these cabalistic signs is made even greater by the fact that these money-names express both the values of commodities and, simultaneously, aliquot parts of a certain weight of metal, namely the weight of the metal which serves as_the · standard of moneyP On the other hand, it is in fact necessary that value, as opposed to the multifarious objects of the world o f commodities, should develop into this form, a material and nonmental one, but also a simple social form." - K1 p. 195

Because historical processes lead to the names of aliquot parts of the original money commodity becoming disconnected from the actual weights they originally represented people can easily come to think that money is a symbol, but really what's happening is that the name is irrelevant. If a pound of gold now only contains an ounce of gold the only way you can get someone to accept that ounce of gold as if it were a pound is through the use of force. Hence Marx's example about an ounce of gold.

> "(Marx, op. cit . , p. 52) [English edition, p. 74]. 1 3 . Cf. ' Theories of the Standard of Money ', in Zur Kritik etc., pp: 53 ff. [English edition, pp. 76] Some theorists had fantastic notions of raising or lowering the ' mint-price ' of money by getting the state to transfer to greater or smaiier weights of gold or silver the names already legaily appropriated to . fixed weights of those metals, so that for example ! ounce of gold could be ·minted into 40 shiilings ill the futw;e instead of 20. However, Petty dealt with these so exhaustively in his Quantulumcunque Concerning Money : To the Lord Marquis of Halifax, 1 682, at least in those cases where they aimed not at clumsy financial operations against public and private creditors but rathet·at · economic quack remedies, that even his immediate followers, . Sir Dudley North and John Locke, not to mention later ones, could only repeat what he said more shaiiowly. 'If the wealth of a nation,' he remarks, 'could be decupled by a proclamation, it were strange that such proclamations have not long since been made by our Governors ' (Petty, op. cit p. 36)." - Footnote 13 from K1 p. 195

Prices and value become disconnected...what happens when that happens?

>"Hence the expression of the equivalence of a commodity with the quantity of money whose name is that commodity's price is a tautology, just as the expression of the relative value of a commodty is an expres"

"The magnitude of the value of a commodity therefore ex­ presses a necessary relation to social labour-time which is inherent in the process by which its value is created. With the transfor­ mation of the magnitude of value into the price this necessary relation appears as the exchange-ratio between a single commodity and the money commodity which exists outside it. This relation, however, may express both the magnitude of value of the com­ modity and the greater or lesser quantity of money for which it can be sold under the given circumstances. The possibility, therefore, of a quantitative incongruity between price and magnitude . of value, i.e. the possibility that the price may qiverge from the mag­ nitude of value, is inherent in the price-form itself. This is not a defect, but, on the . contrary, it makes this form the adequate one for a mode of production whose laws can only assert themselves as blindly operating averages between constant irregularities." - K1 p. 196

Things that do not have value can have prices.

"Things which in and for themselves are not commodi­ ties, things such as conscience, honour, etc., can be offered for sale by their holders, and thus acquire the form of commodities thr ough their price. Hence a thing can, formally speaking, have a price without having a value. The expression of price is in this cas e imaginary, like certain quantities in mathematics. On the other hand, the imaginary price-form may also conceal a real value-relation or one derived from it, as for instance the price of uncultivated land, which is without value because no human labour is objectified in it." - K1 p. 197

"To establish its [a commodity - in this case iron] price it is sufficient for it to be equated with gold in the imagination. But to enable it to render its owner the service of a universal equivalent, it must be actually replaced by gold . If the owner of the iron were to go to the owner of some other earthly  .But price in and of itself is not enough. A price can be expressed, but the exchange between commodity in question and univeral equivalent must occur in real terms for the equivalence to actually be real, for value to be truly exchanged.commodity, and were to refer him to the price of iron as proof that it was already money, his answer would be the terrestrial equivalent of the answer given by St Peter in heaven to Dante, when the latter recited the creed :  · ' A ssai bene e trascorsa D 'esta moneta gia Ia !ega e il peso, Ma dimmi se tu l'hai nella· tua borsa.  ' The price-form therefore implies both the exchangeability of commodities for money and the necessity of exchanges. On the other hand, gold serves as an ideal measure of value only because it has already established itself as the money commodity in the process of exchange. Hard cash lurks within the ideal measure of value." 


# If money is a commodity, it must be produced and distributed

> "It is evident, however, that in countries where gold and silver are produced a definite amount of labour-time is directly incorporated in a definitequantity of gold and silver, whereas countries which produce no gold and silver arrive at the same result in a roundabout way, by direct or indirect exchange of their homeproducts, i.e., of a definite portion of their average national labour, for a definite quantityof labour-time embodied in the gold and silver of countries that possess mines."
- ZK p. 41


# Inflation and deflation can occur because of changes in the conditions of production - either for gold itself or for other commodities

> "Gold must be in principle a variable value, if it is to serve as a measure of value, because only asreification of labour-time can it become the equivalent of other commodities, but as aresult of changes in the productivity of concrete labour, the same amount of labour-timeis embodied in unequal volumes of the same type of use-values. The valuation of allcommodities in terms of gold – like the expression of the exchange-value of anycommodity in terms of the use-value of another commodity – merely presupposes thatat a given moment gold represents a definite quantity of labour-time. The law ofexchange-value set forth earlier applies to changes occurring in the value of gold. If theexchange-value of commodities remains unchanged, then a general rise of their prices interms of gold can only take place when the exchange-value of gold falls. If the exchangevalue of gold remains unchanged, then a general rise of prices in terms of gold is onlypossible if the exchange-values of all commodities rise. The reverse takes place in thecase of a general decline in the prices of commodities. If the value of an ounce of goldfalls or rises in consequence of a change in the labour-time required for its production,then it will fall or rise equally in relation to all other commodities and will thus for all ofthem continue to represent a definite volume of labour-time. The same exchange-valueswill now be estimated in quantities of gold which are larger or smaller than before, butthey will be estimated in accordance with their values and will therefore maintain thesame value relative to one another. The ratio 2:4:8 remains the same whether it becomes1:2:4 or 4:8:16. The fact that, because of the changing value of gold, exchange-values arerepresented by varying quantities of gold does not prevent gold from functioning as themeasure of value, any more than the fact that the value of silver is one-fifteenth of that ofgold prevents silver from taking over this function. Labour-time is the measure of bothgold and commodities, and gold becomes the measure of value only because allcommodities are measured in terms of gold; it is consequently merely an illusion created by the circulation process to suppose that money makes commodities commensurable.[1] On the contrary, it is only the commensurability of commodities as materialisedlabour-time which converts gold into money."
