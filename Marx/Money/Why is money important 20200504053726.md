# Why is money important

Money is the only form of surplus that really matters. Money _is_ of decisive importance in Marx. It is not possible to understand capitalism as an abstracted barter system. Money is not 'neutral'. Surplus _must_ be converted into money to be able to function as money capital.

Money is also required simply to enable the circulation required for simple reproduction.

**Money has to be withdrawn to:**

- Build a hoard for accumulation
- Fund depreciation
- Build a reserve fund to mediate impediments to circulation
