# The money circuit

M -> C (L + MP) ... P ... C' -> M'

1. This is the form of capitalism taken as a totality, although it is in and of itself an illusory form
2. This form presupposes the existence of (1) money, (2) a labour force, (3) pre-existing circulating commodities both in the form of the means of production and commodities required for the subsistence of workers.
3. Therefore it reminds us that capitalism must be *created* through the accumulation of a set of preconditions - it is not an organic form.

# The circuit of productive capital

P... C' -> M' -> C ... P
P ... C' (C + c) -> M' (M + m) - C (M = C(L + MP), m = c) ...P
