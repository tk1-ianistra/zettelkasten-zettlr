# Hoarding

1. Hoard is the practice of taking money out of circulation and storing it.
2. Hoards form when circulation pauses and money comes to rest outside of circulation
3. This is when the two initial forms of money - measure of value and standard of price/medium of circulation - come together into 'money' - an object that can function as both a store of value and a medium of circulation.
4. This is also when the difference between money and 'symbolic tokens' - i.e. fiat currency - becomes critically important, as symbolic currency only embodies the role of money as a medium of circulation, not that of a measure of value 
5. Therefore - a symbolic currency is difficult to truly hoard, because for it to be hoarded there must be a generalised belief within the economy that circulation is likely to resume/continue.
6. Hoarding is the foundation of credit.


"The difference of nature and quantity between the measure of value and the currency both have the effect of separating the general equivalent from its money form, the specific commodity which functions as such in practice. From this arises hoarding, the third function of money, which gold fulfills when "in person **or by representative**, it congeals into the sole form of value, the only adequate form of existence of exchange-value, in opposition to use-value, represented by all other commodities."
- de Brunhoff, Marx on Money, p. 38.

"Hoarding is an interruption in the circulation of commodities; the series of exchanges is broken and temporarily confined to the exchange C-M. This break reflects a desire to fasten M down and keep it. "The money becomes petrified into a hoard, and the seller becomes a hoarder of money." Hoarding is a demand for money as money, the general equivalent possessing special qualities that distinguish it from all commodities."
- de Brunhoff, Marx on Money, p. 39

"Gold and silver "remain liquid as the crystallisation of the process of circulation. But gold and silver establish themselves as money only in so far as they do not function as means of circulation."
- de Brunhoff, Marx on Money, p. 39.

*It is only by removing money from circulation that money can be validated as continuing to function as a measure of value, thereby in turn enabling it to continue as the medium of circulation*

"..."the withdrawal of commodities from circulation in the form of gold is...the only means of keeping them continuously in circulation" and guaranteeing the permanence of the second function of money by preserving the monetary character of the means of circulation. It absorbs the supply of money in excess of the needs arising from transactions. The original "supply" of the money commodity is balanced by a "demand" for money transactions and a "demand" for "money as a treasure," which serves as a fluctuating regulator."

- de Brunhoff p. 40

*Hoarding allows money supply to be regulated to equalise with demand without affecting the price level*

"In order that the mass of money, actually current, may constantly saturate the absorbing power of the circulation, it is necessary that the quantity of gold and silver in a country be greater than the quantity required to function as coin. This condition is fulfilled by money taking the form of hoards. These reserves serve as conduits for the supply or withdrawal of money to or from circulation, which in this way never overflows its banks."

- Marx, quoted in de Brunhoff p. 40

See [[20200317180843]] Marx and Keynes on liquidity for discussion around the motives for hoarding and a comparison between Marx's analysis of hoarding and Keynes' 'liquidity preference'.

*Hoarding also demonstrates that money is not neutral, because it is itself an alternative to other commodities, not just a state of transition between them, so can affect production and exchange decisions. See [[20200317182918]] Neutrality of money*
