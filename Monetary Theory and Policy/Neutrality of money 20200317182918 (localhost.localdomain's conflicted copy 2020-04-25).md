# Is money neutral?

## Marx
>"The excess quantity of money...is only such in relation to a narrow concept of exchanges and a forced identiifcation of commodities and money, followed by an equally forced contraposition of their quantities. Ricardo made the mistake of neglecting hoarding, through which money temporarily ceases to be a social flux and becomes the object of a private possession which restores it to its first state as a general equivalent. Money does not just follow a straight course of demonetization and transformation into currency; it goes through a continuos circuit between non-circulation and circulation. The result is that money, despite the secondary nature of its importance, is not *neutral* and can never be completely neutralized (whether by the development of credit or by monetary policy), since it puts into effect certain private decisions. Money in criculation really belongs to no one, but its very circulation is conditioned on the formation of hoard. These latter are reserves of value which sustain the general equivalent. Their accumulation is sterile, for "Exclusion of money from circulation would also exclude absolutely its self-expansion as capital..."

- de Brunhoff, Marx on Money, p. 43

So here money isn't neutral - where neutrality is defined as being a state moved through in the essential transformation of one commodity into another that has no effect on the prices of those commodities and decisions to produce/exchange, etc (??) - because money is itself an alternative to other commodities???

There's also potentially an important point here in relation to Keynes - Marx makes a distinction between saving and hoarding. Keynes would say that additional hoarding reduces investment, which reduces income, which forces hoarders to draw down on their hoards??


# Purchasing power ex niliho

> Furthermore, the difficulty   cannot be solved by some legerdemain such as the sudden introduction   ex nihilo of additional sources of purchasing power. If new sources of   money do appear - and we shall see that they play a key role in Marx's   schemas - they must be organically connected with the problem under   examination. In other words, it has to be demonstrated that they are   necessarily coexistent with the process of production and circulation of   commodities under the capitalist mode of production.

> More generally, the harmonious flow of expanded reproduction is   constantly threatened (not permanently upset, of course). because there   are always capitalists who buy without selling, and others who sell   without buying. Money is continually being withdrawn from circulation,   and additional money is forever being injected. Only if these movements   roughly cancel each other out will the partially autonomous character   of the money flow not conflict with the need to realize the total value   of commodities produced. While the banking system objectively strives   to achieve that balance (and thus represents a force of social accounting   and centralization far superior to anything private ownership could   accomplish in the realm of production), it does not have the means to   ensure automatic and continual balancing. Here there appears a further   cause of discontinuity or interruption of expanded production - a cause   which, though derived from monetary phenomena, is of course essentially   rooted in the contradictory nature of the commodity and of the pro-  duction of value and surplus-value.

Money flows need to correspond, but cannot without substantial coordination and credit mechanisms.
