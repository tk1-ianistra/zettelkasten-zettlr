Price revolution 20200330200104
-------------------



Price revolution - standard argument is that increase in bullion caused inflation. This is QTM - same strand of thinking goes all the way through to the monetarism, which is a vulgar restatement of QTM.

Assertion that inflation is always a monetary phenomenon - wrong.

Can examples of inflation supposedly caused by increased money supply - e.g. 1970s actually be attributed to conditions of production?

Did monetarism really gain ground just because it was a convenient non-Marxist argument against the gold standard?
