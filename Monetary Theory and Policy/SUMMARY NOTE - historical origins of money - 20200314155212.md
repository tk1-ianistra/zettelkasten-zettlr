# Summary note - The historical origins of money
20200314155212



1. Production begins
2. Need to exchange things between individuals - therefore relate commodities to one another (see Marx's elaboration of the theory of value at the start of K1)
3. Eventually general equivalent emerges - one commodity that can be related to all other commodities and in the process becomes isolated for that specific purpose - see [[20200315162347]] The development of the general equivalent
4. The equivalent is one commodity, the value of which is determined by the conditions of its production [[20200315162144]] A commodity as money implies production of money - at this point gold is still a *commodity* not a measure of price and therefore has a relationship of relativity to all other commodities based on the conditions of production.
5. Then this commodity gets divided up into aliquot parts which are stamped with an essentially arbitrary designation initially based on their weight to make commerce more convenient (we can see here how the disconnect begins to occur - *this is fetishisation and alienation! the fetishisation of the money-form as a bearer of social power actually alienates us from value! from the social relationships of production and exchange that are embodied in the commodities the money-form comes to represent!!!)
