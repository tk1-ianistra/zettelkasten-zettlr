1. Our lives are defined by money and the way it shapes our society.
2. Post-2008 we have had a number of questions thrown into the literature:
    3. "What is financialisation?"
    4. "Do we need to reconceptualise value? How can financial assets have value?"
    5. Inflation and quantitative easing

The memories of most leftists are defined by inflation…

The inflation of the 1960s and 1970s became the nightmare weighing on the brains of contemporary leftists. How can we avoid inflation?

Modern monetary theory attempts to provide an answer to this.

This legacy of inflation terror has left us in a bizarre position in which we live in two separate and irreconcilable worlds. The first is an intellectual world of cowed terror, in which every expansion of public spending will increase inflation, leading to spiralling prices, a collapsing currency and a return to a mythologcial hellscape of pre-Thatcher, pre-Reagan life in which garbage piles in the streets and we each leave our jobs every day to sprint, pushing wheelbarrows piled high with cash, to buy a lump of coal or a bundle of firewood to keep pneumonia at bay for another evening. The second is a material world, in which a continued and vast expansion of global money supply since the floating of the USD has failed to trigger inflation in the set of economies we use as reference points - the US, the UK, Japan, Germany and France.

The main leftist response to this contradiction has been Modern Monetary Theory…

Modern Monetary Theory

We won't be able to avoid these contradictions. The themes that tie this volume together - education, health, housing and work - are all linked to our ability to produce and distribute use-values across a vast population without triggering financial and monetary collapse.

How can we fit all these pieces together?
m
- Financialisation - liquidity and debt
- Currency and money supply - what's the relationship between money supply and debt?



To understand what we call finance we have to return to the most basic foundations of Marx's thought, and of political economy, and build from there.
