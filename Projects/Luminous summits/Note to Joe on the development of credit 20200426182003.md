Hi,

Hope you're well and that the draft is coming along. Please let me know if I can help - e.g. with proofreading, etc.

In the process of writing my chapter, and wanted to send an addendum to my previous email on KII - I've developed my thinking a bit since I sent it, so didn't want you to spend your time responding to it.

The point I made in my previous email was about whether circulation implies a permanent amount of debt proportionate with the quantum of commodities being circulated.

Well - I obviously didn't pay much attention in my first read-through of KII, because the answer seems to be in black and white in part 3.

In his discussion of simple reproduction Marx outlines the issue that I was trying to get my head around in my previous email. The quote I'm referring to is below, but my summary is:

1. Yes, capitalism does require an amount of value embodied as circulating money to be present in the economy to facilitate the commensuration of C'.
2. That amount of 'circulatory money' does theoretically need to increase as the quantum of C' increases, assuming velocity is constant - as he outlines in K1.
3. An amount of idle/potentially circulating money is essential for capitalism to even begin - this is one of the many pre-conditions that make capitalism such an incredibly unlikely system that is so difficult to begin/maintain.\
4.  These initial reserves - hoards - are, as you pointed out in your previous email, along with the credit system they fuelled, pre-capitalist phenomena. They are used by capitalism initially, but this is one of the contradictions of capitalism - it both requires and abhors idle money. Therefore - hoards may form as a capitalist creates a sinking fund for replenishment of their fixed capital, but they, or their bank, will re-invest that money in the interim, rather than actually allowing it to lay idle and accumulate as a true hoard of money as money.

From this, I've been mulling over two (three?) related ideas that I haven't quite been able to connect yet, so grateful for your thoughts on whether there's something here.

**1. Finance as claim on future surplus value**

As we've discussed before, I follow Humphrey in construing financial instruments as different varieties of claims on future surplus value. They enable capitalists to overcome the circulating money constraint 

In a commodity money system it is only possible to lend above and beyond the limits of existing hoards if money is capable of acting as a means of purchase/unit of account. (I need to clarify the distinction between these terms better). That is, it needs to be possible to start generating credits and debits against economic actors without actually settling in terms of the means of payment, which would immediately once again restrict credit creation. It is not possible to lend money as means of payment above and beyond the amount of hoards in place, because it requires the physical transfer of the commodity money.

This reality led capitalists to try to create systems in which mon 


Because of this contradiction involved in maintaining hoards, and the speed of'
But - this lending is exposed to risk because inputs and outputs of production are not (I would suggest, aware there is a debate on this I have not fully engaged with) valued simultaneously. Marx notes multiple times throughout KII that one of the challenges facing capitalist production is the contradiction involved in revolutionising the means of production. As capitalists compete to arbitrage between value and price they begin implementing larger-scale, more capital intensive production processes. At the same time, the competition that compels them to make these investments continues while these investments are still being utilised - the fixed capital involved suffers _moral depreciation_, meaning there is no guarantee that the _values_ of C' will be equivalent to the inputs of C. This is in addition to all the factors re: demand, circulation time, etc, that can cause a capitalist to reduce _price_ in the face of weak demand.

This creates a permanently unstable system that carries significant default risks. If credit is extended on expectations of future surplus value realisation, revolutions in value during production can prevent payment.

This then creates a situation where if a business is to have a 'second chance', they are now under even greater pressure to produce surplus value in the future, to pay back their original and subsequent loans.

I think that facilitating these dynamics has driven a trend in capitalism to try to extend the sphere in which money operates purely as a 'unit of account.' 

Originally central banks tried to imitate the idea of gold reserves by trying to use fiat central reserve balances as a means of restricting money supply. This has essentially been abandoned now, as most of the big 5 central banks no longer impose reserve requirements. 


**2. The contemporary monetary/financial system is the product of an ad hoc evolutionary process triggered by changes in production and technological circulation**

##### Capitalist perceptions of money-supply constraints
1. Capitalists perceive the supply of commodity-money to impose a quantitative limit on the expansion of production, and of credit. This ties into the concept of deflation under a commodity money system. In reality, capitalism naturally generates deflation.

##### Demand for means of payment/credit contraction
3. Disruption to reproduction caused by the demand for means of payment and the contraction of credit
4. 

Technological change drives financial change

Financial change has primarily involved extending the domain in which money is used as 'money of account'

We conceive of the system as the product of active design, not this relatively incoherent process of historical evolution, because money is so fetishised in our society. 

These changes have (1) increased the scale of capital at risk, the length of production time, the amount of the social wealth that is held in unsold commodities at any point in time, etc. This then increases systemic default risk - i.e. the risk that, on a major default, lenders will pull out of the lending market.

A way that we see the 

#### Capitalist solution - expanding the domain of money as unit of account

##### Capitalism has tried to avoid these issues by creating spheres of operation in which participants accept that money operates primarily as a unit of account

The development of clearinghouses reduces
These clearinghouse systems can be subject to internal drain, until the clearinghouse itself begins to act as a creditor and supplants commodity-money reserves with its own 'fiat currencies'. Even where the 'reserves' are not gold, but, for instance, banknotes, external and internal drains can still occur - they just mean that someone is extracting means of payment out of the circulatory system.

External drain occurs when someone operating outside the clearinghouse system wants money as means of payment. This includes two scenarios - a financial system actor outside the clearinghouse wanting payment, or non-financial actors (individuals and businesses) wanting to withdraw hard currency.

Capitalism has tried to combat these issues by extending the domain in which system actors are willing to accept money as a unit of account. It does this in two key ways. 

##### Expanding the scope of the clearinghouse system

##### Enabling electronic payments to reduce the demand for hard cash
First - the expansion of electronic payments technology and the incorporation of most individuals and businesses into the banking system reduces the likelihood of a drain, as then payments can be made between individuals and businesses as money of account solely within the banking system - there is reduced need for cash withdrawals for payment.

##### Centralised lending (removal of reserve restrictions)

However, these systems are still subject to external drain, where actors outside the system who do not accept clearinghouse money as means of payment extract commodity-money from the clearinghouse. The clearinghouse participants are still limited in engaging with out-of-system actors.

This external drain issue becomes a bigger problem as the development of production and circulation technology drives pursuit of bigger and bigger markets, pushing all capitalists toward eventual participation in the world market.

Capitalism has attempted to solve this problem by expanding the sphere in which participants are willing to treat money as money of account.

The global, USD central banking system with its monetary policy levers therefore represents

They are not guaranteeing the availability of means of payment in the face of an external drain threat, rather they are guaranteeing that capitalists will be able to wait for the 

#### Seeing this as a process of historical evolution

One thing that I think is important is that this evolution of money and finance doesn't necessarily make sense. It's not necessarily a coherent system. For instance - if one of the ways that a central clearinghouse mechanism reduces the risk of disruption due to default risk is by creating money, and it will create reserves to fund any liability, then why pretend that reserves influence the money supply? Why did the system of central bank reserve restrictions persist for so long after 1971? Why do so many economists still talk about the money multiplier when central banks and other financial actors are pretty clear about saying that this is a completely wrong model of how the monetary system works? I think the answer lies in the fact that the system we deal with today isn't one that was actively designed. It evolved over time in response to crises, technological change, and the needs of capital. All of its major evolutions were built haphazardly on top of each other in response to specific needs of capital at specific points in time - usually to prevent collapse. That explains why we had, for so long, a central bank reserves system that, even though it never really worked as advertised, seemed to be modelled on the idea of commodity money. This then goes again back to Marx's point about how the commodity-money system, the commensurability of commodities with the universal equivalent, is the starting point for the monetary and financial systems. No matter how complex our financial and monetary system becomes, and how man layers of fixes and abstraction it builds, it still historically derives its ability to commensurate commodities from its original, even if not persistent, relationship with commodity-money. A purely designed 'social contract' system of money under capitalism would be impossible because the designation of a standard of price does not in and of itself imply any kind of measure of value, so the system cannot actually begin to function. Once it is already functioning and participants are bought in because of the original measure of value function, then it can become more abstracted as long as it doesn't lose participants and face competing systems.



**3. We have tried to manage these risks by progressively expanding the environment in which money acts as a unit of account**

Under a commodity-money system in which the money commodity still plays its combination of pre-capitalist and capitalistic roles, 

The idea that I'm trying to feel my way towards here is something like this: A grouping of actors who accept money as a unit of account instead of a means of payment between each other is a grouping in which it is easier to extend credit because the system cannot be subject to internal drain. 

Perry Mehrling talks about this concept of the financial system 'expanding and contracting' during the course of a period of circulation. During the course of, say, a day, capitalists need access to that reserve of money to enable them to make the transactions necessary to commensurate the value of their respective C' and purchase the new C required to begin production again. Because money is distributed unevenly throughout the system, they rely on credit between each other - a system in which they use money as 'money of account' - that, is, they do not necessarily expect the transfer of means of payment, for convenience they are willing to keep these running ledgers of respective debts and net this all out at the end of the circulation period. This means that during the course of the circulation period they lend to each other such that the credit supply 'expands'. Mehrling says that theoretically what happens is that at the end of this circulation period these balances are netted out and means of payment enters the picture as debts are cancelled and paid - credit 'contracts'.

The issue arises when parties have been subject to the revolutions in value or challenges in circulation discussed above, and they cannot pay. These capitalists would usually like a second chance - they would like to go to the credit market and say "I may not have generated surplus value today, but the day after tomorrow I'll generate what I said I would today, and more as well!" The problem they face is that, as Marx says, in a situation like this in a commodity-money system, suddenly the money of account that operates in the clearinghouse doesn't mean a lot - everyone wants to hang onto their gold, and, fearful of losing it and of wasting opportunities to skim surplus value, the creditors won't lend. Some creditors may even withdraw their gold reserves from the clearinghouse and cause the entire mutual money of account system to collapse.

To people who have fetishised money as extensively as, say, monetarists have, the problem here appears to be one not of failures in production, but of inadequate money supply due to a lack of creditors.

This is a problem the more advanced capitalism becomes, because the higher the capital barrier to entry becomes to production, the more is at stake when a particular capitalist fails - the greater the amount of the total social wealth that may now be left unused as capital and decaying.

The financial system has attempted to solve this problem by extending the sphere in which money operates as a unit of account, and increasingly trying to marginalise money as means of payment.

For instance - an early example of this was the development of central clearinghouse loan certificates. If a failing debtor could not get lending bilaterally from a member of the clearinghouse, the clearinghouse itself could step in and issue a loan certificate, essentially backed by the clearinghouse's theoretical confidence in future surplus value. These certificates then began to be traded as well, as 

The next step is networking clearinghouses together. 





All of this that I've described above is then also being driven by underlying technological change. 

Fiat currency system only possible because of global hegemony.


When money of account is used between participants in a financial system, the demand for money as means of payment can be potentially reduced. The more participants are willing to accept money of account instead of means of payment, the easier it is to manage default crises. I think a good example of this is possibly the development of clearinghouses in the US. The 

This analysis would seem to imply that when we reduce interest rates to zero perhaps what we're saying is that we have no real expectations of an increase in surplus value production in the future




**All of this change has been driven by underlying revolutions in the technical means of production**

I think it would be a mistake, however, to characterise what I've described above as being financial revolutiions that enabled capitalism to expand. Rather, I think what's important for this whole argument is to acknowledge that the monetary/financial system is not the product of active design - it is the product of ad hoc historical evolutions off the base of the commodity money system - evolutions which have usually been forced by changes in production and circulation technologies.

For instance - in the US in the 19th century it was not necessarily possible to make payments at par around the country. I.e. - making a payment from Chicago to New York would involve some discounting by the banks involved such that a dollar sent from Chicago could be worth 80 cents when it arrived in New York. This obviously became a significant problem as the railroad system developed and industrial capitalists could no longer tolerate this restriction.

Similarly - it seems 




Your points around the development of the credit system under capitalism and Marx's notes on it in KII have been very helpful in framing my thinking.

The two questions that I've been mulling over are (1) to what extent does valorisation under conditions of expanded reproduction presuppose an increase in credit, and (2) how should I think about the relationship between (a) the commodity-money system, (b) the credit system, and (c ) post-Bretton Woods fiat money as parts of the historical development of capitalism.

On the second question - 

Today I've been mulling over a rather vulgar periodisation (which in itself leads to another question, but I'll get to that later).

It seems to me that the historical process of the development and interaction of the three systems described above has progressed somewhat like this.

The material development of banking and payment technologies places constraints on capitalist development.

The evolution of the banking system is therefore driven by changing technologies of production.

**What happened between WWII and 1971??**

"Electronic funds transfer" was a concept only defined in US legislation in 1978.

Payments technology matters because it determines the sophistication of clearing house mechanisms.

A bigger clearinghouse that can handle a more complex web of payments at greater volume between more payees effectively binds more and more banks into a 'money of account' payment system. They can make payments to each other, run deficits, borrow to cover deficits, trade in different liquidity horizons.

What limits a clearinghouse system?

There are only really two things that can sink a clearinghouse:

- Withdrawal, causing collapse.
- External drains.

In both cases, the conversion of credit money claims into commodity money.

Creation of national clearinghouses made this less and less frequent within economies.

By 1971 it could still happen internationally.

I've read views that under the USD system the 'commodity' in commodity money is really oil. Perhaps that's an argument that could have been made at one point, but I don't think it's true any longer. Oil 

These material changes have driven reactive evolutions in finance. It is a mistake to conceive of money, banking, the finance system in general, as the products of design.

This is exactly what we do when
