Where do we start?

Before I dive into the detail, I think there are two potentially important predicates here. First is that the 

Money evolves out of the the need to make commodities commensurate with each other.
Money is originally a pre-capitalist phenomenon that enables trading of social surplus.

Capitalism develops on top of the foundation of pre-capitalist money.

Capitalism requires that a large mass of qualitatively different commodities be mobilised in production, therefore it requires money.

It requires an amount of money above and beyond that which is transformed into commodities in production to enable circulation.

How is this amount of money generated?

By lending.

Lending represents expectations of future surplus value.

Lending may occur initially from hoards, but ultimately has to occur in money of account, because hoards themselves are a contradiction.

Therefore, they need a way to expand the circulating purchasing power available to capitalists. Capitalists perceive there as being two ways of doing this, although these perceptions are grounded in the fetishisation of money, and reach the wrong conclusions.

**Deflation**

**Increasing the money supply**

There are only two places money can come from - credit and government spending (which in turn often implies credit).

But these systems can only function as long as the participants in the credit system and/or under the government are willing to trade in money of account and continue to indefinitely defer means of payment. 

Money of account is a system in which promises to pay - debts - are monetised and become tradable themselves. The clearinghouse process then is about 

We now face two problems - how to increase the 'money supply', and how to deal with defaults.

**Defaults**
When individual capitalists can no longer advance money into circulation, someone else has to - the government or banks.

However - capitalists do not perceive this whole set of relations as it actually is. Because they cannot coordinate and plan, they instead manage this process of circulation mediated by money through a complex web of inter-relationships between finance capitalists.

This reserve money comes to occur in the form of credit. The same applies if it is the accumulated reserve of one capitalist being lent to another, or it is ex nihilio credit creation. The reserve money is lent, and then spent on means of production to allow the capitalist operation to continue. If that surplus value is not realised, this portion of money has, as Marx says, "gone the way of all flesh", it has been consumed to buy means of production that now no longer function.

Capitalists believe that 'increasing the money supply' is a way of solving this problem without deflation. What I suggest they have been really doing over time is increasing the scope of operation of a system of money of account, and decreasing the potential sources of external drains manifested as calls for the means of payment. I think this has occurred through politically facilitated changes in the way clearing and payments operate in the banking system, triggered by changes in productive technology that have pushed capitalism beyond the scope of what existing clearing and payment systems can handle.

The kind of lending demanded by capitalism relies on the ability to use money as a 'unit of account', and indefinitely delay the calling of money as a means of payment.
This shift toward money of account has historically been driven in big jumps when demanded by the increase of productive powers, and enabled by improvements in communications technology.
This unit of account system has been historically expanded through (a) the development of bigger and bigger clearinghouse systems that encompass more and more of the financial economy, and (b) the development of electronic payments technologies that reduce drains on the clearinghouse system.

Initially there are three ways this clearinghouse system can be undone:
1. A member of the clearinghouse defaults and cannasot organise lending in the clearinghouse system
2. A party outside of the clearinghouse calls on the clearinghouse for payment - this can be another financial institution, or it can also be members of the public withdrawing currency, as in a classic bank run.

These circumstances become more and more likely as obligations within and from the clearinghouse accumulate, and, importantly, as productive technology itself evolves and pushes toward a world market.

Therefore, we see in 1913 the concept of the private clearinghouse absorbed into the state through the founding of the US federal reserve.
The same thing occurs on a world-scale then with the floating of the US dollar.

I think something important here is that I'm not saying that money is by definition credit or a state instrument - I think money is and has been a commodity, credit, and a state instrument. It takes all three of those forms throughout history. It wouldn't be possible for it to function as credit, or for the state to administer it unless it had originally been a commodity and been able to establish commensurability to begin with.



This displaces the money of account/means of payment problem to the international market. External drains continue to occur, notably with the French claims on US gold reserves.
Throughout this, the only reason the concept of 'reserves' is important is because 

There thus arises a kind of quantitative/qualitative relation in wh

Clearinghouses develop. Original private clearinghouses were closed systems that enabled the use of money of account within the clearinghouse, but could still be subject to external shocks. This becomes particularly important as railways and international trade develop. So,

Clearinghouses develop in two important ways. There is a kind of quantity/quality relation in which once the amount of debt being settled in the clearinghouse reaches a certain amount it triggers a need to do 2 things (1) have the clearinghouse become a lender itself through ex nihilio credit creation, and (2) expand the scope of the clearinghouse to include more financial actors and therefore reduce external drains.


Money of account develops as the noting and periodic settling of credits and debits between industrial capitalists or financial institutions that act on behalf of industrial capitalists.

This allows for an expansion of credit supply beyond the scope of pre-existing value, to assist in continuing capital moving. It is constrained, however, by the expectation that at some point in the future this expansion of credit will be reversed and it will contract as these debts are ultimately settled.

This creates an immediate restriction in a bilateral relationship - what happens when the debtor can't convert money of account into means of payment when called to? That individual bank bites the dust and its creditor is probably substantially less likely to lend again in the future.

This is then supplanted by clearinghouses.


Tension between money of account and money as means of payment in the system.
Under commodity money this unit of account lending is ultimately supposed to represent future transfer of money as means of payment after a netting process.
