1. Our lives are defined by money and the way it shapes our society.
2. Post-2008 we have had a number of questions thrown into the literature:
    3. "What is financialisation?"
    4. "Do we need to reconceptualise value? How can financial assets have value?"
    5. Inflation and quantitative easing

The memories of most leftists are defined by inflation…
The inflation of the 1960s and 1970s became the nightmare weighing on the brains of contemporary leftists. How can we avoid inflation?

Modern monetary theory attempts to provide an answer to this.

This legacy of inflation terror has left us in a bizarre position in which we live in two separate and irreconcilable worlds. The first is an intellectual world of cowed terror, in which every expansion of public spending will increase inflation, leading to spiralling prices, a collapsing currency and a return to a mythologcial hellscape of pre-Thatcher, pre-Reagan life in which garbage piles in the streets and we each leave our jobs every day to sprint, pushing wheelbarrows piled high with cash, to buy a lump of coal or a bundle of firewood to keep pneumonia at bay for another evening. The second is a material world, in which a continued and vast expansion of global money supply since the floating of the USD has failed to trigger inflation in the set of economies we use as reference points - the US, the UK, Japan, Germany and France.

The main leftist response to this contradiction has been Modern Monetary Theory…

Modern Monetary Theory

We won't be able to avoid these contradictions. The themes that tie this volume together - education, health, housing and work - are all linked to our ability to produce and distribute use-values across a vast population without triggering financial and monetary collapse.

How can we fit all these pieces together?
m
- Financialisation - liquidity and debt
- Currency and money supply - what's the relationship between money supply and debt?
To understand what we call finance we have to return to the most basic foundations of Marx's thought, and of political economy, and build from there.


### Notes - Joe email 20/04/2020

He notes in KII that hoarding begins as a pre-capitalist practice, alongside the pre-capitalist credit system. So, can we say that hoards developed through primitive accumulation may have helped form a basis for the first shoots of capitalism. But any hoards of actually existing money-as-money are quickly thrown into circulation as capital and tied up at different stages of the process, meaning (1) they are not available to finance these 'misalignments' in production, and (2) they appear to place a quantitative limit on the scale of capitalist development. As you say, what we call think of as the modern credit system evolves on top of/out of the monetary system.

This then goes to the fallacy committed by our friends, the vulgar economists, both today and history, in arguing about whether 'money' is inherently a commodity system (QTM and, in a way, monetarism), a credit system (Keynes) , or a decree of state power (MMT). Money is all three of these things evolving on top of each other throughout a historical process. That evolution is then driven by (1) the fear of deflation that appears to limit 

We begin with commodity money (gold), which can fulfill all the roles of money, but embodies some key contradictions. First - it appears to require a constantly expanding supply of gold in the economy as more commodities are produced. In reality, as Marx notes, gold can continue to function as the measure of value, it is just that if there are more commodities in the market today than yesterday the same amount of gold will represent the same proportion, but a greater absolute amount of those commodities. This becomes a problem not because of the measure of value, but because of the standard of price, which is set in fixed parts. Now that there are more commodities, the amount of gold contained in a piece of currency stamped as a certain aliquot part will buy more commodities, which appears to those looking at the standard of price to be price deflation. The only alternative is to reduce the amount of gold actualy contained in the coin, which then causes debt deflation. Price deflation in and of itself is not an issue - it is to some extent an unavoidable consequence of capitalism anyway, but to individual capitalists it *appears*to mean they are losing money, so reduces their individual willingness to invest.

That appearance leads us to a position then where it appears that the amount of commodity-money in circulation and hoards constrains the extent to which different capitals can simultaneously circulate. Therefore - capitalist credit money begins to develop on top of this. This is then why Marx is so critical of Peel and the Banking Act - the drive to have a hoard of commodity money backing up paper currency is a throwback to a pre-capitalist system that capitalism is in the process of transforming and subsuming.

Simultaneously, we have this practice of 'pre-payment' and forms of Merchants' credit within the circuit that provide a jumping off point for the layering of more forms of credit - claims against surplus value to be generated in the future, used to fund production now.

These two drivers interact then in the monetisation of debt instruments - e.g. promissory notes can be discounted and traded among capitalists, used as a means of purchase, but ultimately only able to stand in as a means of payment to the extent that the future surplus value they are predicated on is actually materialised and theoretically can be paid out in currency, which in turn can be paid out in gold.

Once we shift to a fiat currency system we have a further evolution on top of the credit system that strengthens even further the role of the state in this process. Debt instruments, used as means of purchase, all predicated on a final instrument - USD - that doesn't provide a guarantee of payment in gold, but rather must then provide a guarantee that the state will do everything in its power to ensure all future surplus value that has been promised is delivered. I think this then potentially goes to your point about being trapped - our government has become the guarantor of capitalist's expectations of the future.

The accumulation fund is not centralised in the financial system when money is created *de novo*by banks.
